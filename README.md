👋 Hi, I’m @hanafarah

👀 I’m learning to become a Python Web Developer. My future goal is to expand my coding knowledge by learning about other programming languages such as HTML/CSS/Javascript and SQL/Postgresql

🌱 I’m currently studying Python Web Developer program at Sheridan College in Toronto, Ontario, Canada

💞️ I’m looking to sharing my skills and knowledge in Python, upload Python projects and other coding projects along the way...
